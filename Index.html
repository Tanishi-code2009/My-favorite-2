        <p>My Hobby is Dancing and making choreographies in English music. My most favourite thing after school is Dance. I am 11 years old and I study in 6th standard. Now I really like dancing because it can keep us busy and happy. I got this passsion through my mother becuse she was also a dancer and she taught me how to dance. Everyone should dance because it keeps us really happy. My biggest dream is to become a Ballerina and dance in paris Opera House in front of everyone.</p>
